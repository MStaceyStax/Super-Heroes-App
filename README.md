💭 Project - Duting my selt teaching journey, I joined the FNB APP Academy Program for 2025 of which we were assisgned to create a Super Hero Websit.
🎨 Features - In this beginner website, the core feature is me being able to link different pages of information together and being able to return to the home page. 
📦 Tech Stack - HTML & CSS
🎯 The Process - I started with watch my video tutorials a first time and on the second time a followed along and applied myself into building the same. As I got further along and seeing it come together was a great feeling. I dicussed that I learnt well and fast through      video tutorials. 
✏️Lessons Learnt - There are many different ways of learning. One needs to just start and apply yourself. For me, it was discovering video tutorials.
📈 Areas of Improvement - The further along I got with my course and with my tutorials, it felt like I was discovering a new world and sense of self. I could improve on my visial presentation and interfaces as well as making the website responsive. 
🧠 Overall Growth – Discovering myself as a coder is liberating. 
📚 What I Learned - I have learnt that, websites nedd to be able to catch your eye and to be visually appealing. There are more aspects to a website than just a home page and by learning more than one aspect of development at a time can help when producing your project.      The evidence is in the pudding!
